            Semantic color names make more sense because when we design
            interfaces, we don't just use any random color. We define a specific
            color palette with names like primary, secondary, etc. and we only
            use those specific colors in our interfaces. Also, using semantic
            color names makes theming easier. You wouldn't have to define
            dark-mode colors for every single element and you wouldn't be
            limited to only light/dark themes. you can have multiple themes
            available and each theme is just a few lines of CSS
